## 🎯 **SAFE & LEGAL STRATEGY:**

### **Current Working (180 events):**
- ✅ NOW Magazine: 38 events
- ✅ Existing venues: 142 events

### **Add These (ALL SAFE):**

#### **1. Major Festival Websites (Official):**
- **TIFF:** https://www.tiff.net/ (September)
- **Pride Toronto:** https://www.pridetoronto.com/ (June)
- **CNE:** https://theex.com/ (August)
- **Hot Docs:** https://www.hotdocs.ca/ (April-May)
- **Nuit Blanche:** https://toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/nuitblanche/ (October)

**Expected: +50-100 events when in season**

#### **2. Major Venue Websites (Direct):**
All these are venues that maintain their own calendars:
- Scotiabank Arena
- Budweiser Stage (already have, may need fix)
- Massey Hall
- Roy Thomson Hall  
- Phoenix Concert Theatre
- Lee's Palace
- El Mocambo

**Expected: +40-80 events**

#### **3. Government/Official Sites:**
- City of Toronto events: https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/
- Toronto Parks events
- Public library events

**Expected: +20-40 events**

## 📊 **REALISTIC TARGET:**

| Source | Events | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Current (NOW + venues) | 180 | ✅ Working |
| Major festivals (direct) | 50-100 | 🔧 Need scrapers |
| More venues (direct) | 40-80 | 🔧 Need scrapers |
| City/Gov sites | 20-40 | 🔧 Need scrapers |
| **TOTAL** | **290-400** | **✅ Achievable!** |

## 🛡️ **100% SAFE SOURCES:**

### **✅ Safe to Scrape:**
1. Festival official websites (they want promotion)
2. Venue official websites (they want ticket sales)
3. Government/city websites (public information)
4. Local news/media (news is public)

### **❌ Avoid:**
1. Eventbrite, Songkick, Bandsintown (competitors)
2. Social media (Instagram, Facebook)
3. Private media companies (BlogTO - risky)

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**

### **Option A: Add More Venue Scrapers** (Safest, Quick)

- **New Total:** 230-280 events

### **Option C: Both A + B** (Best Overall)
