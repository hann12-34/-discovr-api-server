Create scrapers for:
1. **BlogTO** (Toronto) - expect +30-50 events

3. NYC & Company

**Expected Result:** +50-100 events

---

### **PHASE 3: Fix Existing Scrapers** (SLOW - ongoing)

Only focus on:
- Venues with traditional HTML websites
- Venues that use Squarespace/WordPress
- Jazz clubs, live music venues (usually have simple sites)

**Skip:**
- Modern React/JavaScript sites
- Instagram-only venues
- Venues using competitor widgets

---

## 📈 PROJECTED RESULTS:

```
Current: 67 nightlife events

After Phase 1 (Media):      170-240 events (+103-173)
After Phase 2 (Tourism):    220-340 events (+50-100)
After Phase 3 (Venues):     300-400 events (+80-60)

TOTAL GOAL: 300-400 nightlife events ✅
```

---

## 💡 KEY STRATEGY:

**ONE media scraper = 50+ events**  
**ONE tourism scraper = 30+ events**  
**ONE difficult venue scraper = 0-5 events**

**Focus effort where there's maximum return!**

---

## 🚦 DECISION NEEDED:

**Should I:**

**Option A:** Create 5-10 media/publication scrapers NOW (BlogTO, Vancity Buzz, Village Voice, etc.)  
→ Fast, high impact, will add 100-200 nightlife events

**Option B:** Continue fixing individual venue scrapers  
→ Slow, uncertain results, might only add 10-20 events

**Which one?**
