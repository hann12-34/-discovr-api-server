    "description": "Thursday, December 19th at 9:30pm 14A – May include suggestive language and/or scenes. Hot Snack invites you to the totally improvised holiday event of the season! The punchbowl’s 80% rum, the food’s overcooked, and there aren’t enough coat hooks. Someone just claimed to have changed your diapers, though you’ve never seen them. Join us for a night of hilarious conversations, quirky relationships, and holiday chaos. Expect gifts, snacks, and unsolicited advice—but no stress, because it’s not your family or coworkers!",
