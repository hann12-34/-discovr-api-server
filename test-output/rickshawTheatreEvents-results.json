And, although I got to work with some Prog-associated artists–GTR (Steve Hackett and Steve Howe) and Marillion–my career took a decidedly different, though incredibly fortunate path, with artists such as Alice Cooper, Joe Satriani, Aretha Franklin, The Tubes, Shakira, Julian Lennon and others. That being said, I never lost my desire to play the Prog I grew up listening to.”\n\nHe adds: “The idea and inspiration came in 2019 from my getting a last-minute rescue call to play with the Genesis tribute band, The Musical Box. That not only relit my childhood fire and desire, but made me realize: in the tribute world, if there’s an audience for Genesis, and an audience for Pink Floyd, and YES, and Rush, there must be an audience for King Crimson, Gentle Giant, U.K., Bruford, and Jethro Tull, too. So, why not play them all, since I love them all, and assemble a team of extraordinary musicians that feel the same as I? So I did. And they, like me, wanted to play a wide variety of Prog from all our favorite bands, and therefore thought more of the concept of a legacy ‘homage band’, instead of a tribute band.”\n\nMover says that “the chemistry and dynamics of ProgJect are amazing” and “we’re all very excited to hit the road again, especially now with Alessandro singing; with his four-and-a-half octave range, there are no limits to what we can cover. We love playing this music so much and know how much prog fans love it too, and now more than ever, since most of our prog heros are either gone, or simply not touring anymore.”\n\nWhat is the enduring appeal of Prog? “It’s music that you really listen to, and in some ways, live in,” says Mover. “It’s not music to be played in the background. When you’re into Prog, you’re not only really into listening, but often times, attached to it as well. It’s the same for seeing it played live. It’s more than just a music performance–it’s an experience.”\n\nTickets: Tickets available online\n\nThe Rickshaw Theatre is located at 254 E Hastings Street in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.

Ward & The Undertakers\n\nSeveral times, as I listened to M. Ward’s supernatural thing, I asked myself what year it was. Was it 1952, and was I listening to a track from the Harry Smith Anthology? Was it 1972, and was I eavesdropping on the recording session for After the Gold Rush?\n\nNo, it’s 2023, and M. Ward is one of the special contemporary artists who invite such questions. Ward has clearly mastered the whole vocabulary of American popular music and made serious decisions about how to employ it for his own ends. What Ward shares with Harry Smith’s artists and Neil Young is a context of musical and human values: authenticity and intimacy. supernatural thing’s original songs sound freshly pulled from the ground, with a little earth sticking to them. Ward’s lyric delivery has that slight rawness the ear loves, and his voice has quiet dignity and great tenderness. Supernatural Thing is an open-hearted, inviting album.\n\nmwardmusic.com\n\n\n\n\nBob Sumner\n\nSinger-songwriter Bob Sumner cites the musically progressive sensibilities of his heroes when talking about the spirit of his new album, Some Place to Rest Easy, out now via Fluff & Gravy (worldwide) and North Country Collective (Canada). “They were always creating something new, something different,” he says of idols like George Jones, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings. With that ideology in mind, Sumner set about creating an album that takes as much inspiration from the audio production of Randy Travis as it does the lyrical soul of Big Thief’s Adrianne Lenker—a melding of eras, sounds, concepts, and stylings that’s informed by the past, but never bound by it.\n\nWith Some Place to Rest Easy, Sumner picks up the tempo compared to his previous releases, balancing the stirring lyrical depth fans have come to expect with a more buoyant, lively feel. “It felt appropriate to give the music itself some joy,” says the man who’s made a career out of tapping into difficult-to-touch-on, real-life stuff in a relatable, palatable manner. In the end, that’s what Sumner’s music has always been about—more than a single sound, influence, instrumental, or clever line. “I always want people to feel something,” Sumner explains. “If I heard that this album helped somebody that was feeling down, even just by feeling some other emotion for a little while, that's the number one thing for me.\n\nbobsumnermusic.com\n\n\n\n\nRSVP on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nRefund Policy\n\nNo refunds, unless event is cancelled.

    "description": "The Rickshaw and Eastside Arts Festival presents\nYoung Friend\nWith guests, Babe Corner, worrywart and Kylie V (solo)\nJuly 25th, 2025\nThe Rickshaw Theatre\n19+\nDoors: 7:00pm\n\n\nYoung Friend\n\nDrew Tarves' music as young friend feels classic and immediate all at once, capturing the nostalgia of post-adolescence while diving deep into a pool of self-reflection. His new album, Motorcycle Sound Effects, is bursting with big feelings and perfect golden light. It feels messy and raw, like long summer nights piling into the back of a pickup truck with all your friends, sprinting to catch the last summer sunset, taking off your shoes and dancing in the grass, falling, getting back up.\n\nA trained dancer for most of his adolescence, the 24-year-old Vancouver native switched artistic disciplines after spending time jamming with his musician friends. \"I found out very quickly that I loved it,\" he recalls. \"It was my favorite thing to do.\" Armed with a guitar and a laptop, Tarves started hashing out early songwriting attempts on Garageband as he found his own style that suited him: \"It was all about experimenting while trying to find what worked for me.\"\n\nIn 2022, Tarves released his indie-pop debut EP HOW DID WE GET HERE? and quickly followed it up with a sophomore in 2023 titled scaredy cat. 2024 brought in his first Canadian and international touring as well as a Juno nomination. Now, young friend is releasing his debut full length, Motorcycle Sound Effects, that’s produced by friend and frequent collaborator David Marinelli (Wallice, Finneas, spill tab). The album pulls inspiration from a multitude of places and artists, landing in this comfy space of new and familiar while also making room for self-discovery. Motorcycle Sound Effects takes you along for the ride of your life. “This album takes notes from a lot of different artists and bands that I really love, and as a result it is this sort of genre-bending fever dream album.”\n\nyoungfriend.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n\nBabe Corner\n\nBabe Corner is a rock band hailing from Vancouver, BC, Canada. Known for their captivating guitar riffs, dreamy synths, and soothing melodic lead vocals, the band brings a nostalgic rock vibe to life, elevated by lush four-part harmonies.\n\nIn 2023, Babe Corner released their debut LP, Crybaby, introducing their signature sound - a mix of heartfelt emotion and infectious energy. With a second LP set to drop later in 2025, the band continues to carve out their own genre, aptly dubbed “Babe Core.” But don’t try to define them too neatly, after all, nobody puts Baby in a corner.\n\nbabecorner.band\n\n\n\n\nworrywart\n\nworrywart blossoms from friendship, stitched tight in stretching the edges of sounds that attached them to music in the first place. Making noise for queer love and celebrating tender explorations of anxiety - they bring a sparkling grunge energy to performances. Their dynamics on stage demonstrate a clear commitment to make every show electric and memorable for everyone they share space with.\n\nworrywart urges you to dance in spiteful joy, and hold your people through the collapse. xoxo\n\nworrywart.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n\nKylie V\n\nKylie V can level you with a single note. With their operatic voice and appetite for the devastating, Kylie’s discography is a blast of sonorous and explosive indie folk. Ranging from twisted tranquility to cataclysmic crescendoes, over a terrain of barest honesty and intricate rhythms, they capture the tender perils of love, loss, and sacrifice in evocative poetry.
