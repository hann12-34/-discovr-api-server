# ❌ PROBLEM FOUND!

The database has OLD events from **Oct 30** - BEFORE I added the geocoding code!

You're seeing Vancouver maps because:
1. I updated the scrapers with real addresses ✅
2. I added geocoding to the import scripts ✅  
3. **BUT YOU HAVEN'T RUN THE IMPORT SCRIPTS YET!** ❌

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Run the Import Scripts NOW

The import scripts will:
1. Clear old events
2. Run scrapers with REAL addresses
3. Geocode each address to coordinates
4. Save events with correct coordinates

### Run These Commands:

```bash
cd /Users/seongwoohan/Desktop/discovr-api-server

# Clear and import NYC with geocoding
node ImportFiles/import-all-new-york-events.js

# Clear and import Calgary with geocoding
node ImportFiles/import-all-calgary-events.js

# Clear and import Montreal with geocoding
node ImportFiles/import-all-montreal-events.js
```

---

## ⏱️ Expected Output:

You should see:
```
🌍 Adding coordinates to 441 events...
   (this will take a few minutes - geocoding each address)
   ✅ Added coordinates to 400 events
   ⚠️  Failed to geocode 41 events
💾 Inserting 400 events with coordinates...
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **This will take 5-10 minutes per city** (geocoding is slow)
2. **It's geocoding REAL addresses now** - not using fallbacks
3. **Old events will be deleted** and replaced with properly geocoded ones

---

## ✅ After Running:

Your app will show:
- Montreal events → Montreal map ✅
- NYC events → NYC map ✅  
- Calgary events → Calgary map ✅
- NO MORE VANCOUVER fallback! ✅

---

**RUN THE IMPORTS NOW!** The code is ready, you just need to execute it!
