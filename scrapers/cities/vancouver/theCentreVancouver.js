One of America's most distinctive storytellers, Sedaris will share new and unpublished works, read from his latest bestseller, and take questions from the audience. His personal essays and social critiques combine autobiographical elements with razor-sharp observations on modern life, creating stories that are both deeply personal and universally resonant. Sedaris' material ranges from family dynamics and international travel mishaps to cultural peculiarities and the absurdities of everyday interactions. His delivery‚Äîcharacterized by impeccable timing and deadpan humor‚Äîtransforms even the most mundane situations into laugh-out-loud narratives. Following the reading, Sedaris will be available for a book signing in the lobby, where his latest works will be available for purchase. This performance is suitable for mature audiences and contains adult themes and language that some may find provocative.",

The evening includes a Q&A session with audience members, offering fans the rare opportunity to engage directly with one of literature's most influential voices. Atwood's incisive intellect, wry humor, and uncompromising viewpoints promise an evening of thought-provoking discourse that extends beyond literature to address the most pressing questions of our time.",

This special Vancouver edition features a carefully curated selection of Canadian classics, global hits, and a few surprise arrangements specifically created for this event. Choir! Choir! Choir! has previously orchestrated large-scale performances at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, and Massey Hall, and has collaborated with renowned artists including David Byrne, Rufus Wainwright, and Patti Smith.
