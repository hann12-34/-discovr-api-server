        description: "Join us for a special 19+ evening at the Space Centre focused on exoplanets and the search for alien life. This adults-only event transforms the Space Centre into an after-hours science lounge featuring expert talks, planetarium shows, telescope viewing (weather permitting), and interactive demonstrations. Dr. Sara Rodriguez, exoplanet researcher from UBC's Department of Physics and Astronomy, will deliver the keynote presentation on recent discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope and what they tell us about potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. The evening includes a special planetarium show 'Worlds Beyond' that takes audiences on a tour of the most fascinating exoplanets discovered to date, from scorching hot gas giants to potentially Earth-like rocky worlds. Throughout the night, enjoy themed cocktails from our licensed bar, explore the exhibits without crowds, and participate in hands-on activities including spectroscopy demonstrations showing how scientists detect elements in exoplanet atmospheres. The observatory will be open for guided stargazing through our telescopes, weather permitting.",

Our Junior Astronauts day camp provides children ages 6-8 with an immersive, hands-on introduction to space science through engaging activities, demonstrations, and interactive learning. Campers will build and launch their own model rockets, create Mars rovers using simple machines, design space habitats, learn about astronaut training, and explore the solar system through daily planetarium shows tailored to their age group. Our experienced educators guide children through scientific concepts using play-based learning approaches that make complex ideas accessible and exciting. The week culminates in a special 'graduation ceremony' where junior astronauts demonstrate their new knowledge to family members and receive official certificates. All materials and daily healthy snacks are provided; children should bring their own lunch and water bottle each day. Extended care options are available before and after regular camp hours for an additional fee. Space is limited to ensure a high-quality experience with appropriate staff-to-child ratios.",

'Origins: The Birth of Our Universe' utilizes state-of-the-art digital projection technology to visualize the latest scientific understanding of how our cosmos began and evolved. The 45-minute show begins with the Big Bang and traces the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the birth of our solar system, and the emergence of life on Earth. Narrated by renowned astrophysicist Dr. Neil Patel, the presentation combines cutting-edge scientific visualization with an emotional narrative about our cosmic connections. The show features data-driven animations based on actual observations from space telescopes including Webb, Hubble, and Chandra, making complex cosmological concepts accessible to audiences of all backgrounds. This feature presentation runs daily throughout the summer and is included with admission to the Space Centre. The immersive dome experience is enhanced by our newly upgraded 8K projection system and spatial sound technology that creates a truly multisensory experience of cosmic evolution.",
