As their academic rivalry intensifies and the authenticity of their discovery comes into question, the performance devolves into a hilarious blend of genuine Elizabethan verse, wild improvisation, and scholarly meltdowns.

Five performers weave together stunning acrobatics, personal narratives, and visual poetry as they literally and metaphorically explore what it means to fall and rise again.
