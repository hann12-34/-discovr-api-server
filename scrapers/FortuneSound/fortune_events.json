A legend of NYC‚Äôs underground noise scene, Dreamcrusher weaponizes distortion and intimacy to build a sound that feels like spiritual warfare. Every performance is an exorcism. Every track, a confrontation with the boundaries of music and self. This is the kind of show people lie about being at 10 years later.ü©∞ DEVOURS (Vancouver, BC)Electropunk poetry for the maladjusted queer body. Devours makes glitchy, glittery pop for outsiders who have read too much theory and danced through heartbreak. Come see why they‚Äôre one of the city‚Äôs most beloved provocateurs. There will be sequins. There will be grief.üï∏Ô∏è MASKARA (Nanaimo, BC)Queer non-binary noise from the Snuneymuxw coast. Maskara is anti-pop for post-gender cyborgs. NXC highness. You don‚Äôt watch their set - you get swallowed by it. Built for bodies that don‚Äôt fit anywhere but still move through the world like art.ü™û CITADEL‚ÄúHave you ever seen a portal?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs the vibe. Citadel makes disintegrating pop, dreamtrap for the politically possessed. Equal parts defiance and desire, this is music for people who hate money, reject fame, and quote Fannie Lou Hamer between songs. Your new favorite band you can‚Äôt quite explain.-üí∏ This show cost over $17,000 to produce.What could that money have done?THIS WORLD IS A PARTY NEXT TO AN EXTERMINATION CAMP.Come ready to die.\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n‚Ä¢ Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n‚Ä¢ Do not buy from someone you don't know\n‚Ä¢ Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion",

From his roots with D.C.‚Äôs Low Budget Crew and the raw energy of Diamond District to leading his genre-blurring band Good Compny, he's carved out a lane all his own. Whether it‚Äôs the cinematic sweep of Rock Creek Park, the introspection of The Iceberg, or the soulful urgency of To What End, Oddisee‚Äôs catalog hits hard and stays smart.

Inspired to make music by spending blurry mornings in nightclubs together, Kerala Dust is where art rock meets innovative electronica and the warm embrace of the dancefloor leaves room for the expansive vistas of Americana, desert blues and twilight drives through a neon-lit city. Kerala Dust has a wonderfully shapeshifting sound; a restless fusion where meaning is found in fragments rather than anything fixed or static. The live experience is massive and energetic, a dynamic exploration of the bands eclectic catalog.\nTickets ‚û§\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n#FortuneSound\n@FortuneSound\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n‚Ä¢ Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n‚Ä¢ Do not buy from someone you don't know\n‚Ä¢ Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion",
