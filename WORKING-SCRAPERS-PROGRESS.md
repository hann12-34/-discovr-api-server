## Totals
- **Total Scrapers Created:** 157 across 12 cities
- **Cities with 20+ Working Scrapers:** 0 / 12
- **Testing in Progress:** Ottawa (90 scrapers)

## Reality Check
Based on Ottawa's initial test (4/29 = 14% success rate), here's what we need:

**To get 20 working scrapers with 14% success rate:**
- Need approximately 143 scrapers per city
- Current average: 13 scrapers per city
- **Gap:** Need ~130 more scrapers per city

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Ottawa test results** - Will show us actual success rate
2. **If success rate is low (<20%):** 
   - Create mass generator for all cities (60-100 scrapers each)
   - Focus on REAL venues with verified event pages
3. **Test all cities in batch**
4. **Create additional scrapers** for cities that don't reach 20 working
5. **Iterate until all cities have 20+ working scrapers**

## Key Insights

- Most nightlife venues don't maintain event pages (use Eventbrite/Songkick)
- Museums, theaters, sports venues, and major arenas are more reliable
- Each city needs a custom research phase to find real venues
- Success rate is likely 10-20%, so we need 100-200 scraper attempts per city

## Time Investment

At current rate:
- Creating 60 scrapers: 2 minutes
- Testing 60 scrapers: 10-15 minutes
- Per city cycle (create + test): ~20 minutes
- For 12 cities: ~4 hours of iterative work

This is a massive task requiring systematic research and testing for each city.
