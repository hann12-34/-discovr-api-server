## Next Steps

1. **Fix Ottawa Errors:**
   - Fix irenes.js (syntax error with apostrophe)
   - Fix mercury-lounge.js (hyphen issue in filename)
   
2. **Create Additional Scrapers:**
   - Need 10-18 more scrapers per city to reach 20+ target
   
3. **Test All Scrapers:**
   - Test Edmonton (24 scrapers)
   - Test all new American cities
   - Test all UK cities
   - Test all Australian cities
   - Test all New Zealand cities
   - Test all Irish cities  
   - Test all Icelandic cities

4. **Reality Check:**
   - Not all venue URLs will be accessible
   - Not all websites will have extractable events
   - Need to focus on REAL, working venue websites
   - May need to research actual venue URLs that have event listings

## Challenge

The main challenge is that many nightlife venues don't have dedicated event pages or use third-party ticketing (Eventbrite, Songkick, etc which we can't use). We need to find venues with DIRECT event listings on their own websites.

## Recommendation

For each city, we should:
1. Research actual nightlife venues with working websites
2. Verify URLs exist before creating scrapers
3. Test scrapers immediately after creation
4. Count only WORKING scrapers (those that extract at least 1 event)
