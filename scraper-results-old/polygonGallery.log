  "title": "Star Witnesses: Indigenous Perspectives on the Night Sky",
  "description": "Star Witnesses brings together work by contemporary Indigenous artists from across Canada and internationally who use photography, video, sound, and installation to explore celestial knowledge and humanity's relationship with the cosmos. This landmark exhibition examines how Indigenous peoples have observed and documented the night sky for millennia, developing sophisticated astronomical knowledge systems that connect scientific observation with cultural practices, spiritual beliefs, and environmental stewardship. Featured artists include Joi T. Arcand (Cree), Nicholas Galanin (Tlingit/UnangaxÃÇ), Caroline Monnet (Anishinaabe/French), Alan Michelson (Mohawk), and Tarah Hogue (M√©tis/Dutch), among others. The works in this exhibition reveal how traditional star knowledge informs contemporary Indigenous identities and how these perspectives can help address modern environmental challenges. Through various media, the artists reframe astronomical narratives, challenge colonial structures of scientific authority, and assert the continuing relevance of Indigenous celestial teachings in understanding our place in the universe.\n\nEVENT DETAILS:\nExhibition Dates: Saturday, July 5, 2025 - Sunday, September 14, 2025\nHours: Tuesday-Sunday, 11am-5pm (Thursdays until 9pm)\nVenue: The Polygon Gallery, 101 Carrie Cates Ct, North Vancouver\nPrice: By donation (suggested $10)\n\nVenue Information: The Polygon Gallery is located in Lower Lonsdale, North Vancouver, at the foot of Lonsdale Avenue on the waterfront.
