  "title": "Cosmic Nights: Exoplanets & Alien Worlds",
  "description": "Join us for a special 19+ evening at the Space Centre focused on exoplanets and the search for alien life. This adults-only event transforms the Space Centre into an after-hours science lounge featuring expert talks, planetarium shows, telescope viewing (weather permitting), and interactive demonstrations. Dr. Sara Rodriguez, exoplanet researcher from UBC's Department of Physics and Astronomy, will deliver the keynote presentation on recent discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope and what they tell us about potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. The evening includes a special planetarium show 'Worlds Beyond' that takes audiences on a tour of the most fascinating exoplanets discovered to date, from scorching hot gas giants to potentially Earth-like rocky worlds. Throughout the night, enjoy themed cocktails from our licensed bar, explore the exhibits without crowds, and participate in hands-on activities including spectroscopy demonstrations showing how scientists detect elements in exoplanet atmospheres. The observatory will be open for guided stargazing through our telescopes, weather permitting.\n\nEVENT DETAILS:\nDate: Saturday, July 12, 2025\nTime: 7:00 PM - 11:00 PM\nVenue: H.R.
