  "description": "Known as 'Canada's biggest little birthday party,' the Steveston Salmon Festival celebrates both Canada Day and the community's rich fishing heritage. This beloved Richmond tradition features a grand parade through Steveston Village, a salmon barbecue where over 1,200 pounds of wild salmon are grilled over open alder wood fires, and a Japanese cultural fair honoring the area's significant Japanese-Canadian history. The festival grounds at Steveston Park include multiple stages with live music ranging from folk to rock, cultural performances, children's activities and games, a trade show featuring local artisans, and a food fair showcasing diverse cuisines. The Horticultural Show displays prize-winning flowers, vegetables, and floral arrangements from local gardeners, while the Youth Festival provides opportunities for young performers to showcase their talents. The day culminates with a spectacular fireworks display over the Fraser River, celebrating both Canada's birthday and Steveston's maritime heritage in a quintessentially Canadian community gathering that has been running for over 75 years.\n\nEVENT DETAILS:\nDate: Tuesday, July 1, 2025\nTime: 10:00 AM - 11:00 PM\n\nLocation: Steveston Village\nAddress: 4111 Moncton Street, Richmond, BC V7E 3A8\nPrice: Free (some activities may have fees)\nTickets: Not required for general admission\n\nFor more information and updates, visit the official HelloBC event listing at https://www.hellobc.com/events/steveston-salmon-festival-2025/",
