Joined by our finest friends, DJ Express and Destrata. Tickets go on sale tomorrow, March 4th at 10am–you know the drill, do not sleep on these!\n*Interplanetary Criminal is the Manchester-based producer, DJ and ATW Records co-founder leading a rip-roaring new wave of UK garage. Straight from the studio to the iconic Arcadia spider, and from Dekmantel to Depot Mayfield, Croatia, Bogotá, Sydney, Miami and all-nighters at Leeds’ beloved Wire, IPC and his speedy, rowdy sets – and speedier, rowdier productions – are connecting with up-for-it audiences. His formula? Fresh, fun and foundation-minded, balancing innovation with a wholehearted appreciation for everything that’s come before, including the enduring influence of the North West.  His dedication is paying off. Recent years have seen IPC (real name Zach Bruce) earn DJ Mag’s Best of British awards for Best Producer and Best Track, along with a Brit Award nomination. He’s played ecstatic b2bs with legends like Skream, remixed for formative heroes like Dusky and been a regular on Rinse FM. Not to mention all the music he’s created and shared, counting 2022’s celebratory “All Thru The Night” V/A compilation for the seminal Locked On label. Plus, of course, the chart-topping “B.O.T.A. (Baddest Of Them All)” – an irresistible collab with Eliza Rose.\nTickets ➤ https://on.fortunesoundclub.com/trk/s554b\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n#FortuneSound\n@FortuneSound\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion",

They blend 90s house, breakbeat, and electro-indie to create a vibrant, energetic sound. Their debut EP, Baggy$$, released in 2024 via Ninja Tune's Technicolour imprint, features tracks like \"Bon Bon\" and \"Homie Don’t Shake.\" Known for their high-energy live performances, they’ve sold out shows in New York, London, Tokyo, and Paris, drawing inspiration from the underground dance scene. In 2025, they performed at Coachella and previously made waves at Pitchfork Music Festival Paris, further growing their international fanbase and pushing the boundaries of modern electronic music.\nTickets ➤\nwww.thisisblueprint.com\n#FortuneSound\n@FortuneSound\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion",

A legend of NYC’s underground noise scene, Dreamcrusher weaponizes distortion and intimacy to build a sound that feels like spiritual warfare. Every performance is an exorcism. Every track, a confrontation with the boundaries of music and self. This is the kind of show people lie about being at 10 years later.🩰 DEVOURS (Vancouver, BC)Electropunk poetry for the maladjusted queer body. Devours makes glitchy, glittery pop for outsiders who have read too much theory and danced through heartbreak. Come see why they’re one of the city’s most beloved provocateurs. There will be sequins. There will be grief.🕸️ MASKARA (Nanaimo, BC)Queer non-binary noise from the Snuneymuxw coast. Maskara is anti-pop for post-gender cyborgs. NXC highness. You don’t watch their set - you get swallowed by it. Built for bodies that don’t fit anywhere but still move through the world like art.🪞 CITADEL“Have you ever seen a portal?”That’s the vibe. Citadel makes disintegrating pop, dreamtrap for the politically possessed. Equal parts defiance and desire, this is music for people who hate money, reject fame, and quote Fannie Lou Hamer between songs. Your new favorite band you can’t quite explain.-💸 This show cost over $17,000 to produce.What could that money have done?THIS WORLD IS A PARTY NEXT TO AN EXTERMINATION CAMP.Come ready to die.\nPlease be aware of ticket scams!\n• Only buy tickets online through our website or Official Promoters\n• Do not buy from someone you don't know\n• Buying resale tickets is at your own discretion",
