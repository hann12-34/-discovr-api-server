/*
üö® IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:

1. For NEW scrapers:
   - Import city enforcement at top: 
     const { enforceCityAssignment, validateEventCity } = require('../../../utils/city-assignment-enforcer');
   - Process each event: enforceCityAssignment(event, __filename)
   - Validate before adding: validateEventCity(event)

2. For EXISTING scrapers:
   - Add the import and processing at the END
   - Replace return with processed events

3. For KNOWN venues (like Poetry Jazz Cafe):
   - Add them to KNOWN_VENUES in city-assignment-enforcer.js
   - They'll automatically get correct city/address

4. For IMPORT scripts:
   - Also use enforceCityAssignment on all events before DB insert
   - This is the FINAL safety net

üéØ RESULT: 
- NO MORE undefined cities
- Automatic city assignment based on scraper folder
- Known venues get correct addresses
- Data integrity guaranteed!
