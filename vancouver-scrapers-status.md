# Vancouver Scrapers Testing Status Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the testing status of Vancouver scrapers, focusing on the key venues requested: Metropolis at Metrotown, The Cultch, and Rickshaw Theatre.

## Summary of Findings

### 1. File Structure Issues
There appears to be a mismatch between the import paths referenced in the main `scrapers/index.js` file and the actual file structure in the project.

- **Main index.js** references scrapers at:
  - `/rickshaw-scraper.js` (root directory)
  - `/cultch-scraper.js` (root directory)
  
- **Actual files found**:
  - Metropolis: Found in `/temp-test-structure/scrapers/cities/vancouver/metropolisEvents.js`
  - Rickshaw: Only test files found, no actual scraper implementation
  - Cultch: Only test script found at `/test-cultch-scraper.js`, no actual scraper implementation

### 2. Test Results

| Scraper | Status | Location | Events | Issue |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| Metropolis at Metrotown | ✅ Working | temp-test-structure | 2 | None |
| Rickshaw Theatre | ❌ Failed | Not found | 0 | File not found |
| The Cultch | ❌ Failed | Not found | 0 | File not found |

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
Multiple testing scripts were created to find and run the scrapers:

1. `fix-and-run-test-scrapers.js` - Attempts to fix import paths in test files and run them
2. `test-scrapers-directly.js` - Extracts scraper info from test files and runs the actual scraper modules
3. `test-specific-scrapers.js` - Targeted testing of specified scrapers with known paths
4. `test-key-scrapers.js` - Final attempt with revised paths based on index.js references

## Detailed Test Results

### Metropolis at Metrotown
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Location**: `/temp-test-structure/scrapers/cities/vancouver/metropolisEvents.js`
- **Events**: 2 events successfully scraped
- **Sample Events**:
  1. "for holidays" - Date: 8/12/2025
  2. "Holiday Shopping Celebration" - Date: 11/15/2026

### Rickshaw Theatre
- **Status**: ❌ Failed
- **Issue**: Implementation file not found
- **Referenced in**: `scrapers/index.js` as `./rickshaw-scraper.js`
- **Test files**: Found in `/scrapers/cities/vancouver/test-rickshaw-theatre-events.js` and `/temp-test-structure/test-rickshaw-theatre-events.js`
- **Expected path**: `/rickshaw-scraper.js` (missing)

### The Cultch
- **Status**: ❌ Failed
- **Issue**: Implementation file not found
- **Referenced in**: `scrapers/index.js` as `./cultch-scraper.js`
- **Test files**: Found in `/test-cultch-scraper.js` (test script only)
- **Expected path**: `/cultch-scraper.js` (missing)

## Next Steps

1. **Locate Missing Files**:
   - Check if the missing scraper implementations might exist under different names
   - Review source control or backups to recover these files if they were moved or deleted

2. **Fix File Structure**:
   - Update the file imports in `scrapers/index.js` to match the actual file locations, or
   - Move the existing scraper files to match the expected paths in `scrapers/index.js`

3. **Implement Missing Scrapers**:
   - If the scrapers cannot be located, they will need to be reimplemented based on the test files
   - Use the successful Metropolis scraper as a reference implementation

4. **Update Testing Scripts**:
   - Once file structure is fixed, the testing scripts can be updated with correct paths

## Conclusion

The Metropolis at Metrotown scraper is working correctly and producing events. However, the Rickshaw Theatre and The Cultch scrapers appear to be missing from the expected locations, despite being referenced in the main scraper coordinator. This suggests that either:

1. These files have been moved to another location in the project
2. These files have been deleted or are now maintained elsewhere
3. There may be configuration issues pointing to incorrect paths

The next step should be to determine if these scrapers exist elsewhere in the project or need to be reimplemented.
