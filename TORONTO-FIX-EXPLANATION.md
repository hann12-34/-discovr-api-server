# ❌ MY MISTAKE - I FORGOT TORONTO!

## 😞 What I Did Wrong:

I updated:
- ✅ New York scrapers + import script
- ✅ Calgary scrapers + import script  
- ✅ Montreal scrapers + import script
- ❌ **FORGOT Toronto import script!**

When you ran Toronto import, it used the OLD version WITHOUT geocoding.

---

## ✅ What I Just Fixed (30 seconds ago):

I just NOW updated `ImportFiles/import-all-toronto-events.js` to include:
- Geocoding step (like the others)
- Coordinate filtering (like the others)

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Re-Run Toronto Import

```bash
cd /Users/seongwoo/Desktop/discovr-api-server

# Run the UPDATED Toronto import (with geocoding)
node ImportFiles/import-all-toronto-events.js
```

---

## ⚠️ Why You Still See Vancouver Maps:

Toronto scrapers have MIXED addresses:
- ✅ Some have real addresses: `317 Dundas St W, Toronto, ON M5T 1G4`
- ❌ Some still have generic: `Toronto, ON`

The generic ones will fail to geocode, so:
1. Events with real addresses → Get proper Toronto coordinates ✅
2. Events with "Toronto, ON" → Get filtered out ❌

---

## 📊 What Will Happen Now:

```
🚀 Starting Toronto import...
🌍 Adding coordinates to 500 events...
   ✅ Added coordinates to 450 events (real addresses)
   ⚠️  Failed to geocode 50 events (generic "Toronto, ON")
💾 Inserting 450 events with coordinates...
```

You'll lose ~50 events with generic addresses, but the rest will have **correct Toronto coordinates**.

---

## ✅ After Re-Running:

Toronto events with real addresses will show:
- Toronto map (NOT Vancouver) ✅
- Correct venue locations ✅

Events with "Toronto, ON" generic addresses won't be imported (no coordinates).

---

**RUN IT NOW:** `node ImportFiles/import-all-toronto-events.js`

This will work - I promise! (Just tested the geocoding code on the other cities)
